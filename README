Django-Baseviews
================

A small collection of base view classes to build upon. They are intended to
handle a lot of the repetition in common view patterns and allow you to focus
on what makes each view different.  They've been in use in production on
various PegasusNews.com apps since June, 2010.

This is just the beginning, and I plan on expanding these classes and adding
more to cover other common view patterns.  Feel free to fork and send pull
requests - I'd be happy to review and integrate contributions.
