Django-Baseviews
================

A small collection of base view classes to build upon. They are intended to
handle a lot of the repetition in common view patterns and allow you to focus
on what makes each view different.

This is just the beginning, and I plan on expanding these classes and adding
more to cover other common view patterns.  Feel free to fork and send pull
requests - I'd be happy to review and integrate contributions.
